-- ðŸ”„ Churn Analysis: Identify Customers Inactive in the Last 30+ Days
-- ðŸ“Œ Purpose: Segment users based on recency to support re-engagement and retention strategies

-- ------------------------------------------------------
-- ðŸ“¦ 4.1 Calculate Cumulative Days per User Since First Order
-- ðŸ”¹ Goal: For each user and order, compute the running total of days since their first order

WITH recency_calc AS (
    SELECT
        o.user_id,
        o.order_number,
        SUM(COALESCE(o.days_since_prior_order, 0))

                PARTITION BY o.user_id 
                ORDER BY o.order_number 
                ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
            ) AS total_days

-- ðŸ“… 4.2 Get Days Since the Most Recent Order Per User
-- ðŸ”¹ Goal: Identify how long each user has been inactive

        MAX(total_days) AS days_since_last

-- ðŸ‘¥ 4.3 Bucket Users into Active, At-Risk, and Churned
-- ðŸ”¹ Goal: Create churn buckets based on recency thresholds

        user_id,
        days_since_last,
        CASE
            WHEN days_since_last <= 30 THEN 'Active (0â€“30d)'

-- ------------------------------------------------------
-- ðŸ“Š 4.4 Aggregate Bucket Counts and Calculate Metrics
-- ðŸ”¹ Goal: Summarize user count, % share, and average inactivity for each bucket

SELECT

    COUNT(*) AS user_count,
    CAST(100.0 * COUNT(*) / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER() AS DECIMAL(5,2)) AS pct_users,
